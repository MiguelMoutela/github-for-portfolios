    <p>On first visit to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>, you can create a new account with just your email address and by choosing a username with
alphanumeric characters.</p>

    <p>Be sure to check your email afterwards to <strong>confirm</strong> the registration.</p>

    <p>The next screen will ask you to <strong>choose your personal plan</strong>. For a monthly price, you get to host projects privately. But since we’re not
making anything that needs to be hidden or propietary, we can choose the <strong>Free</strong> plan, which allows us to create an unlimited number of publicly
visible projects.</p>

    <p>In git-vocabulary, <strong>repositories</strong> (or <em>repos</em>) can be thought of as <em>projects</em>. Or less abstractly, think of them as <em>folders</em> in which we store our files (and subfolders).</p>

    <p>That means that a repo can contain anything we want. Not just code files, but images and documents, just like file folders on our computers.</p>

    <p>Navigate back to the <a href="//github.com">Github homepage</a>. Now that you’re a new member, Github will helpfully point out that you have 0 repositories.</p>

    <p>Click the green <strong>New repository</strong> button to get started.</p>

    <p>Our first repo, i.e. <em>project</em>, will be our portfolio site.</p>

    <p>Github has a special feature, <a href="//pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, in which the contents of a repo can be auto-published onto their webservers. This is what we want. To enable this feature, we have to follow a specific naming convention. </p>

    <p>For the <strong>Repository __name</strong>, enter your <strong>username</strong>, followed by <code>github.io</code>. You must use your <em>exact</em> username or else Github Pages will not be enabled.</p>

    <p>All of the other fields, including <strong>Description</strong>, can be left alone for now. Hit the green <strong>Create Repository</strong> button.</p>

    <p>Congrats, you are now the owner of a new Github repository.</p>

    <p>If you are unfamiliar to git, about 95 percent of this screen will be totally alien to you, and, for our portfolio purposes, irrelevant.</p>

    <p>For now, revisit <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> to see what the homepage looks like.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-6">

    <p>The homepage is largely unchanged, but you’ll see that our repositories list is no longer empty. Clicking on the repo name will take you to <strong>that repo’s
homepage</strong>, which will be the same confusing screen we had just navigated from.</p>

    <p>For now, let’s take a quick look at your <strong>user</strong> page, which you can visit by going to:</p>

    <pre><code>    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME
</code></pre>

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Most of this will be irrelevant to you right now. You haven’t done anything besides
create a repository, so your <strong>Contribution Activity</strong> will be empty.</p>

    <p>However, since we’re not currently using Github to collaborate or work on team projects, most of
this screen won’t matter to us right now. But if you visit the page of an active user, such as <a href="https://github.com/hadley">Hadley Wickham</a> 
of R/ggplot2 fame, you can see how Github is basically a social network for developers.</p>

    <p>What’s important to know is that this is simply your Github account/user page, and <strong>not</strong> the homepage for the <strong>repo</strong>
that contains your portfolio, i.e. <code>yourname.github.io</code> </p>

    <p>Let’s go to that page now by clicking on the listed repo link.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-readmemd">Creating a README.md</h2>

<section class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

    <p>On our empty repo page, the one instruction we should care about is the one that says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Click on the <strong>README</strong> link, which conveniently takes you to the Github file editor.</p>

    <p>The Github file editor lets you create and edit files in your web browser. The more you get experienced with git and Github, 
the less you’ll be using this feature. But it’s convenient for trying things out.</p>

    <p>Notice at the top of the file how <code>README.md</code> has been filled out for you. You <em>could</em> enter
any filename you want. But let’s stick with <code>README.md</code></p>

    <p>The <code>md</code> file extension is short for <strong>Markdown</strong>, which is a mini-language that is meant to be
a simplified, human-friendly version of HTML.</p>

    <p>I <em>highly</em> recommend <a href="http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/">learning Markdown at some point</a>, 
but the upshot here is that you can type in any text you want, it doesn’t have to be code. If you already know HTML, you can
write some now. But to get a taste of how Markdown works, just type in text as if it were a plain-text editor.</p>

    <p>Besides plain text, paste in a few URLs (<em>sans</em> <code>&lt;a&gt; tags</code>), such as the link to your repo page and Github account page.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the page, you can ignore the optional fields and just click the green button to <strong>Commit new file</strong></p>

    <p>After creating the file, you’ll be taken back to your portfolio repo’s homepage, which now contains one file: <code>README.md</code></p>

    <p>Besides creating and adding the <code>README.md</code> file to the repo, that <strong>Commit new file</strong> action has  helpfully recorded some useful metadata, including when the “commit” took place and a short description: <code>Create README.md</code>. </p>

    <p>As we’ll see later, “commit” is not synonymous with “create”. A commit can consist of <em>changes</em> (including deletions) to one or multiple existing files.</p>

    <p>Scroll down a bit and you’ll see that Github has rendered <code>README.md</code> – even though it was just plaintext – as if it were a real webpage. This is a special convenience feature of Github, to treat <code>README.md</code> as a sort of boilerplate informational webpage for visitors of your repo homepage.</p>

    <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> your actual portfolio page. Again, think of a repo as simply a folder for your project, and this is how Github displays the project’s file listing.</p>
