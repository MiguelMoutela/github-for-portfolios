title: "Using Pre-Manufactured Github Pages"
---

In this lesson, we will explore the "AutoTK" generated webpage feature of Github Pages, which, with a press of a button, we can get a nice looking page from Github Pages' pre-built templates.

But because the entire purpose of this tutorial is to create something of our own, from scratch if necessary, this chapter is meant to be entirely optional. Pretty as Github Pages' templates are, they can't accomodate the variety of things and expressions that  we may want.

However, the reality of modern web development is that you're almost always starting from someone else's foundation, and tweaking it to your needs. As it is Github Pages auto-TK does _too much_ for our tastes. But the scaffolding, the concept is the same. 

After it's done with the magic, Github leaves us with a pile of raw text files -- just like every other web project. So if you've never built a website, this is a brief practical overview of how things fit together so that you're _less initimidated_ at the thought of creating a web site from scratch, and that you don't see it as magic, but somethign you can freely examine for yourself.

(And if you've ever built or maintained a website, you can probably skip this chapter entirely.)
