# How to build a Web Portfolio from Scratch with Github Pages

<a href="http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios">(![at the moma](/images/main-logo.jpg)</a>

A layperson's step-by-step guide to building webpages with Github. You can visit the live tutorial (which itself was publislhed via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) at:

[http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/](http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/)


This guide is meant for the __true layperson__, someone who has a minimal-to-non-existent grasp or awareness of HTML, Git, Github, and the command-line. That being the case, this guide attempts to guide the reader through Github's web-interface to explore how to build a webpage from scratch.

At the end of the tutorial, the goal is for the user to have a basic website that they can edit and manage themselves and that can function as a respectable web portfolio. __However__, this tutorial does not purport to teach even basic web development or programming skills. On the other hand, the user can expect to have a good starting spot from which to experiment and iterate if they want to learn web development on their own, especially if they want to continue improving their personal website.
